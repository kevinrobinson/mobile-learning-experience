ADVICE:
  --- encourage ---
  "you're working hard!"
  more videos/problems per day, or time on site per day, compared to other students
  -> encourage

  "you're really dedicated!"
  most consistent minutes/day
  -> encourage habit
  -> project what could be if they keep this up

  --- corrective ---
  "you're not as engaged as other successful students"
  -> set up daily email reminders

  "you're struggling with this problem, these resources have helped other students"
  -> video
  -> other problems
  -> connect with students directly
  for a problem
    did students succeed based on videos, prior problem attempts, or prior knowledge/learning out of band?

  "you're trying to do a lot at once!  try limiting what you work on and focus on one at a time"
  -> withdraw from course, limit activity to only one

  --- identify as leader ---
  "you're learning really effectively!"
  success with less videos/attempts/time on site than other students - actually probably from prior knowledge, or being too conservative
  -> nudge to be a resource for others
  -> encourage to challenge further

  "you're one of the top performing students!"
  -> nudge to be a resource for others
  -> encourage to challenge further
